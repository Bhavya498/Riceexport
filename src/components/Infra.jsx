                        <h3>Procurement Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            Carrying the document, Evidence of Weighing, Quality Check Results Sheet, and Payment Order are the important aspects of the export.
                            This process requires a lot of understanding and a database of rich markets.
                            For quality assurance, we associated with intermediates i.e. Kaccha Aarti, and a chain of farmers.
                            This intermediate helps us to procure high and premium quality rice.

                    <p>
                        Our rice mills are a stage of art and to attain the desired quality of rice we need to use pre-cleaners, de-huskers, polishers, sortex, silky, rice bins, and magnets to completely protect the food. And this process leads against contamination and other impurities during the food process of milling. The natural form of rice is inedible, hence there are several operations that need to be done for the final product.

                    <h3>Drying Of The Rice At Drying Plant</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our company has installed a unique fully automatic and mechanized sensor-based temperature-controlled drying system with metric tonnes per hour drying capacity which ensures the consistency and uniform drying of paddy without breakage of grains while processing. Our technology avoids fungal, and bacterial infections, fermentations, and retaining of the natural aroma.

                    <h3>Parboiling</h3>
                    <p>
                        To maintain and preserve the natural fragrance and aroma of the grains during the whole process we need to do Parboiling. The grains become free from unwanted smells and are hygienic. Itâ€™s steam for removal of the Hull and Barn layer. In this process paddy is kept for soaking for 12hrs in water and in every 4 hours needs to change water for no bacterial formation, thus ensuring the best hygienic and parboiled rice always. These steps ensure 100% quality of rice for the end user. Maintaining the temperature is an essential and crucial step as normal water hampers the taste and aroma of grains.

                        Milling is the last and final step of the overall procedure. Our professional team of employees ensures 100% quality control, right from the procurement of paddy, milling, parboiling, the cleaning process, packaging, and logistics. The only aim of our company is to provide the best service and highly nutritious rice with exceptional quality and aroma as our company is upgrading the working system every year.
